# Myweather
A simple weather web app using OpenWeatherMap API with dynamic backgrounds and real-time location detection.

This is a small weather web app I built using simple web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – without any frameworks.  
The idea started from a curiosity: *"Can I build something useful and good-looking using only what I already know?"*  
So I created this app that shows the current weather based on your location or a city you search for — with a smooth UI that changes depending on the temperature.

## ✨ What it does

- 🔍 Lets you search for the weather by city name
- 📍 Automatically finds your location on first load using IP
- 🌡️ Shows current temperature, max/min, and a short description
- 🎨 Background adapts depending on whether it's hot or cold
- 💎 Styled with a clean, soft-glass (glassmorphism) look

## 🔧 What I used

- HTML5 + CSS3 (custom properties, backdrop blur)
- Vanilla JavaScript (no libraries)
- [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/) for live weather data
- [IP Geolocation API](https://ipgeolocation.io/) to detect user location
